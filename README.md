# Employee-Attrition-dashboard
Leveraged Python (Pandas) for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean HR data and built a Power BI dashboard that pinpointed ’Overtime’ as a primary attrition driver, facilitating evidence-based retention strategies.
Headline: Retention Strategy: Diagnosing the Root Cause of Employee Turnover

The Story (The "Why"): High employee turnover is expensive, but often companies guess at the reasons (thinking it's always about salary). I wanted to use data to move from "guessing" to "knowing" exactly why employees leave.

The Solution: This was a hybrid technical project. I first used Python (Pandas) to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and clean the raw, messy HR data. Then, I fed this refined dataset into Power BI to build a diagnostic dashboard.

Key Insights:It's Not Just Money: The analysis pinpointed "Overtime" as the primary driver of attrition—far outweighing other factors like age or distance from home.
Strategic Value: This finding allows HR departments to focus less on generic perks and more on workload balancing, providing an evidence-based strategy to retain top talent.
